  description: >
    The SPI Engine Offload peripheral allows to store a SPI Engine command and SDO
    data stream in a RAM or ROM module. The command stream is executed when the trigger
    signal is asserted. This allows the execution of SPI transactions with a very
    short delay in reaction to a event.
